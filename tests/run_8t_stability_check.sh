# Cell-level stability regression for the ASAP7 true-dual-port 8T bitcell.
#
# The macro contract in docs/asap7_8t_bitcell.md declares concurrent
# same-address read/read legal, and every cell in a row half-selected on both
# ports sees the same bias.  Both rest on the cell's strength ratios, which are
# inherited from the published single-port 6T -- cell ratio 1.0 with one port
# selected.  Nothing measured that until this gate.
#
# Everything runs on the bitcell alone, no periphery, so a failure points at
# the cell rather than at a sense amp or a write driver.
#
# Scope: this is nominal corner stability, not a Vmin or a yield number.
# SRAM margin is a distribution and the mean is only half the story;
# docs/characterization_plan.md puts the Monte Carlo half out of scope.  What
# this does settle is the *relative* question -- how much margin concurrent
# dual-port access costs against single-port -- which is a ratio of two
# measurements on one cell and is insensitive to that caveat.
