"""Assemble and route the 2RW macro from real ASAP7 hard-cell geometry.

Every disconnected supply component is a separate routing terminal.  Physical
pin connectivity is extracted again after DEF stream-out before publishing GDS.
The controller is the already placed/routed ctrl_decode from this compiler run.

A column is one unsplit array with port A's IO at one end of the bitlines and
port B's at the other.  ``--wordlines`` is still NUM_WL, the rows one row-select
address field covers; the array has twice that, the address bit above the
column select being the top bit of its wordline index.

The data bits are two stacks of abutted column tiles with the controller band
between them.  Each stack's wordlines run through its tiles by abutment and
are driven at its edge by a pair of driver strips (chipforge_asap7's
DriverSliceSpec, four wordlines a slice): port A's strip against the array,
port B's flipped under it sharing a VSS rail and reaching the M5 wordlines
through a via stack and strap.  Those wordline nets are never routed: the
connectivity gate proves them through the abutments instead.

With ``--share-port-b`` the banks go in pairs and a tile is a pair's column
for one bit: ``port A IO | array | port B IO | array | port A IO``, the second
bank's half the first's mirrored, so one two-sided port-B block serves both
arrays.  The second bank's strips are the first's mirrored the same way.
